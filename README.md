**Project Overview**

 This project analyzes a retail company's supply chain using vendor, product,
 inventory, purchase order, and sales data. The goal is to improve supply chain efficiency, vendor
 reliability, and inventory management.

**Objectives**

 Evaluate vendor performance using delivery and defect metrics. Analyze inventory
 movement, stockouts, and turnover. Identify supply chain bottlenecks. Measure order cycle times
 and delivery delays. Provide overall supply chain KPIs and recommendations.

**Dataset Overview**

 The project uses five datasets: Vendors: Lead time, on-time delivery rate,
 defect rate, cost and quality ratings. Products: Category, reorder level, cost, vendor mapping.
 Inventory: Stock level, safety stock, stockout days, movement rate. Purchase Orders: Ordered vs
 received quantity, expected vs actual delivery. Sales Orders: Daily product-level sales.
